# FH6leafAI
leafAI for Futurehacks 6

# Inspiration
Since this hackathon was themed on AI in societal challenges, I based my project on the problem of climate change. Since climate change is a major issue that needs to be addressed, and not many people know what to do about it, this AI was designed to help people understand how they can save their environment. 

# What it does
leafAI is an AI tailored to answer any environmental questions that you have. Also, this website includes a multiple-choice game, in which correct answers can be found with use of the AI! Correct answers give you 1 point, and you can earn more points as you answer more questions! A daily leaderboard would be put up to show how you stand against others using the website.

# How we built it
leafAI uses the Gemini API to run its AI powers! Creating a whole new AI from scratch requires lots of time and money, but this API can help us set up our AI easily. leafAI is tailored to answer environmental questions via context by it’s. The prerequisite chat history in the code helps leafAI learn from context and answer questions accordingly.

# Challenges I ran into
Coding a new web app comes with challenges. Firstly, the main challenge I faced was trying to output the response of the AI to the actual website. Before, it would push out its results to the console and the user couldn’t see the generated text. Now, the generated text is pushed out to the website using JS commands. Another problem I would say would be styling the website itself. Sometimes the CSS properties would not work and not work with the actual backend, so a lot of revisions we needed to make the website aesthetics look better

# Accomplishments that I’m proud of
I’m proud that I could get a responsive web app that runs AI and as well can ask questions to you in a day or so.

# What we learned
I’ve learned a lot about Gemini’s API and how it can be used for developers. I experimented a lot with Google’s AI studio to test the AI and train it. I have also learned a lot of new JS commands and features that I would love to implement in upcoming projects.

# What's next for leafAI
leafAI is at its basic functionality. After this hackathon, leafAI will become polished and fixed to make a responsive leaderboard, an interactive AI, and make it look better overall.
